## üöÄ Models and Training

### 1. **EfficientNet**
EfficientNet is a family of neural networks that are optimized for performance and efficiency. In this project, EfficientNet is fine-tuned to classify MRI images into tumor/non-tumor categories.

### 2. **ResNet50**
ResNet50 is a deep residual network that overcomes the vanishing gradient problem by using skip connections. It allows the model to go deeper with better accuracy.

### 3. **Xception**
Xception is a powerful model built on the depthwise separable convolution idea. It's highly efficient for image classification tasks and is fine-tuned for our specific dataset.

### 4. **VGG16**
VGG16 is a classic CNN architecture that uses a stack of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers for classification.

Each model is trained using the **Adamax optimizer** and evaluated on the test set. The models are compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
1. **Accuracy**: Overall accuracy of the model in classifying the images.
2. **Precision**: How many of the predicted positive cases were correct.
3. **Recall**: How many of the actual positive cases were correctly identified.
4. **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
5. **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the model's performance in a matrix form.
6. **AUC-ROC Curve**: Evaluates the true positive rate against the false positive rate across thresholds.
